# TeacherGen@I

![Demo](demo.gif)

TeacherGen@I is a teacher simulation integrated with generative AI that allows pre-service teachers to interact with students in a virtual classroom environment without burden. In this simulation, users can utilize their prepared teaching materials and speak verbally to students at their target level. Each virtual student agent with a unique persona is powered by generative AI and provides real-time responses reflecting learning objectives, class context, and their individual characteristics.
